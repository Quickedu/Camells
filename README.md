# Camel race 🐫
This program is the typical game where you have to put the balls into the holes, so your camel runs, but in this case, you win if you get faster at clicking space than the program at making them run.
The game only has the option to choose how many players you want in the game (min 2, max 7) and to make your camel go further in the race by pressing the space.
It's a one player game, you can't play it with more than one player (you play against the machine)

Not very hard exercice we used to practice inheritance
